// It is used to execute the function immediately after it is created in order to avoid pollution from the global scope

//You've to explicitly add ';' at the end of the function expression to avoid any errors otherwise the further code will give error and not execute as the first function haven't ended with ';'

// Syntax : (function(){})(args)
